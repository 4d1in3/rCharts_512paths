# Challenge to Recreate 512 Paths with Slidify and rCharts
Seeing the amazing work of Ramnath Vaidyanathan inspired me to attempt to recreate one of my favorite visualizations of all time -- [NYT 512 Paths to the White House](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html?_r=1&) -- using R with slidify and rCharts.  The exercise has filled in lots of gaps in my knowledge of these two packages, especially how they might integrate.

## Problem
As you can see the index.md is rendered from slidify, but the index.html is blank.  The rCharts 512paths layout is working just fine.  Actually, I just discovered that the minimal framework is still causing me problems.  Bootstrap renders just fine.
