## [NYTimes 512 Paths to the White House](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html?_r=1&) Recreated in [R](http://r-project.org) with [rCharts](http://ramnathv.github.io/rCharts) and [slidify](http://ramnathv.github.io/slidify). 

**I claim absolutely no credit for this visualization, which I consider as one of the most instructive I have ever seen.  If anybody believes this to be not fair use, I will take it down immediately.**    
The only changes to the code remove dependencies on NYT for the d3 and svg/png graphics.  Also, as an illustration of how we can do this, data is provided from R rather than the original d3.tsv method.

```{r results='asis'}
require(rCharts)
#get data from downloaded NYT tsv and inject in through params
data <- read.delim(file = "data/states.tsv")
p1 <- rCharts$new()
p1$field( 'lib', '512paths' )
p1$set( data = toJSONArray( data ) )
p1
p1$print( 'g-chart' )
```
